    import {remark} from 'remark'
    import {read, write} from 'to-vfile'
    import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
    import preset from './preset.js'

    const file = await remark()
      .use(preset)
      .process(await read('example.md'))

    console.error(reporter(file))
    await write(file)
