#### feature-components
Here "feature-components" means components "bound to" or using presentational/domain/infrastructure logic.

#### sections
Sections structure components to make up an isolated section of a viewport.

#### pages
Pages structure components/sections to make up an entire viewport.

Both pages and sections may distribute logic/data amongst their children.

The term viewport is subjective here, if the cloud editor is embedded into another app it can be thought of
as the box within which the cloud editor resides.
